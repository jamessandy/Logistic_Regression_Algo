# Logistic_Regression_Algo

I’m going to implement standard logistic regression from scratch. Logistic regression is a generalized linear model that we can use to model or predict categorical outcome variables

Since the likelihood maximization in logistic regression doesn’t have a closed form solution, I’ll solve the optimization problem with gradient ascent. Gradient ascent is the same as gradient descent, except I’m maximizing instead of minimizing a function. Before I do any of that, though, I need some data which i will generate.
